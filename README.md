Module main.py is created to show specific locations of films that were produced in a year, put by a user. 
On a html map you can see up to ten films that were produced in this year with the closest distance to the location of the user.
For the efective work of the module you should enter the database, year and your location(latitude and longitude).

some nations or amount of films that were made in specific year.
